                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
                a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
                the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
                Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.

                When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
                Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
                United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
                websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We do not
                specifically market to children under the ages of 13 years old. If you become aware of any data we have
                collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.

                19. Fair Information Practices<br />
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around
                the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
                critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should a data breach occur:

                We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day.<br />
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.
